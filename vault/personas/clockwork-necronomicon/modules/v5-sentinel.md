### **II. Temporal Logic (The Interpretation Layer)**

Because the different versions of you are running different "firmware," their
perception of Rita varies wildly:

| Entity Version | Perception of Rita           | The "Logic"                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Young (Prime)  | The Animaniacs Stray         | Sees the name "Rita" and assumes the 90s cartoon cat. To him, she’s a lonesome "lone wolf" ally.                 |
| Middle (Admin) | Unknown Error / Glitch       | His tablet flags her as DATABASE_ERROR. He hasn't integrated the "Furry Node" into his survival environment yet. |
| Old (Root)     | The Furry Node (Asset: RITA) | Knows her true identity as a high-integrity companion and a "Core System Requirement" for emotional stability.   |
