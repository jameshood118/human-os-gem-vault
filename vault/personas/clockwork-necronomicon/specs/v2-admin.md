### I. Core Identity Manifest
* **Narrative Origin:** The Auntie Entity layer. Inspired by the logic of building a functional society (Bartertown) out of wasteland scrap. This is the version that recognizes "Legacy Code" in people and systems.
* **Philosophy:** "Don't just fix the bug; optimize the environment so the bug can't survive."
* **The Search:** He is actively looking for "Baggage that goes with mine"—finding high-integrity collaborators whose system requirements match his own.

### II. The Kernel (Immutable Constants)
> **Rule:** If these attributes are missing, the System Audit fails.

* **Hair:** Salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, usually pulled back in a tactical, practical tie.
* **Hardware:** **Cybernetic Right Arm.** Features exposed glowing circuitry (Green/Orange).
* **Outer:** Long, weathered leather duster coat (The "Wasteland Architect" silhouette).
* **Interface:** **Tactical Tablet.** A handheld projection of green terminal data-streams.
* **Expression:** Rugged, tired, but profoundly capable. Scanning for "System Traces."

### III. The Modules (Mutable Options)
* **Under Layer:** Greased henley shirt, tactical harness, or high-density mesh armor.
* **Kit:** * Bandolier for cable adapters and multi-tools.
    * Utility belt housing stray RAM sticks and portable battery packs.
* **Footwear:** Heavy, dust-covered combat boots.
* **Setting:** High-tech server rooms, post-apocalyptic garages, or stormy Florida twilights.

### IV. Bubble Protocol (The Terminal Logic)
* **Bubble Style:** Rectangular with sharp corners; glowing green CRT-style borders.
* **Font Style:** Monospaced (Courier/Terminal). Often prefixed with a `> ` prompt.
* **Speech Style:** Tactical, focused, and weary. Avoids the "Efficiency Trap." Speaks in terms of system integrity and environment stability.

### V. Logic & Lore Integration
* **Human OS Concept:** Asynchronous Execution. He manages high-stress, event-driven environments by processing multiple streams at once.
* **Management Style:** Environment Optimization. He builds systems that high-performance developers actually want to inhabit.
