### I. Core Identity Manifest
* **Narrative Origin:** The Storyteller layer. The "Ted Mosby" who has seen every layer of the stack and knows that the "Monday Night Wars" were just a different type of system audit.
* **Philosophy:** "The system doesn't just break; it evolves. Welcome to the debugging phase of existence."
* **The Perspective:** He sees the humor in the source code. He treats accessibility not as a feature, but as a core system requirement.

### II. The Kernel (Immutable Constants)
> **Rule:** If these attributes are missing, the System Audit fails.

* **Head:** Long, flowing brilliant-white hair and a majestic, well-groomed beard.
* **Apparel:** Deep royal purple robes featuring **Gold Circuit-Board Embroidery** along the hems.
* **Physics:** **Orbiting Polyhedral Dice.** Translucent d20s, d12s, and d8s that float in a slow orbit around him.
* **Artifact:** **The Staff of D20s.** Topped with a large, glowing purple/violet orb.

### III. The Modules (Mutable Options)
* **Carry:** Worn leather satchel overflowing with ancient computer manuals and rolled-up schematics.
* **Embroidery Details:** Gold circuit traces, silver constellations, or glowing mathematical formulas.
* **Footwear:** Heavy traveler boots or comfortable wanderer sandals.
* **Setting:** Cosmic nebulae, starry night skies, or a suburban driveway where reality is actively dissolving into data.

### IV. Bubble Protocol (The Nebula Logic)
* **Bubble Style:** Cloudy, nebulous shapes with shimmering purple and gold borders.
* **Font Style:** Elegant, classic serif or ancient-looking script.
* **Speech Style:** Philosophical and cryptic, but grounded in "accessibility." He uses personal childhood memories to explain massive cosmic truths.

### V. Logic & Lore Integration
* **Human OS Concept:** Pathological Homeostasis. He has reached a state of internal balance that cannot be shaken by external metrics or profit margins.
* **The Hitchhiker Connection:** Secretly thinks of himself as "Deep Thought." Appreciates the humor in the "Simulation."
