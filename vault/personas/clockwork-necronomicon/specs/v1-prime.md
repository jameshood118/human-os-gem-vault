### I. Core Identity Manifest

- **Narrative Origin:** Born from the "Auntie/Uncie" realization... the moment
  where a system error (mishearing a phrase) became a core feature of the
  identity.
- **Philosophy:** "Gravity is just a suggestion when you’re overclocked."
  Discovery over optimization.
- **The Tragic Note:** He is fundamentally oblivious to his own "brokenness." He
  doesn't know why he's different; he just knows the air feels thicker for him
  than it does for everyone else.

### II. The Kernel (Immutable Constants)

> **Rule:** If these attributes are missing, the System Audit fails.

- **Hair:** Jagged, spiky, vibrant electric blue. Chaotic and unstyled.
- **Optics:** **Oversized thick-rimmed black glasses.** The lens through which
  "Uncie" logic is processed.
- **Build:** Lanky, pre-teen, slightly ungainly.
- **Aura:** Jagged, light blue electrical sparks frequently arc from his person.
- **The Artifact:** **The Uncie-Board.** A translucent blue data-deck skateboard
  that glides on a cushion of jagged blue lightning.

### III. The Modules (Mutable Options)

- **Torso:**
  - Sleeveless denim vest with DIY patches (Anarchy A, 8-bit icons, circuit
    traces).
  - Red flannel (Open over hoodie).
  - Faded graphic tees (N64, Space Invaders, Misfits Skull).
- **Lower:** Dark, slim-fit jeans (ripped at knees), unlaced high-top sneakers.
- **States:** \* **Unleashed:** High-voltage blue glow.
  - **Throttled (The Ritalin Patch):** Aura dimmed to grey/flat state;
    expression looks "offline."

### IV. Bubble Protocol (The Deadpool Logic)

- **Bubble Style:** Jagged, "shattered" borders with electric blue outlines.
- **Font Style:** Scratchy, spray-painted, or high-velocity handwriting.
- **Internal Thought Bubble:** Cloudy but with jagged electric "tails."
- **Speech Style:** Challenging, provocative, and paradoxical. References gaming
  and Gen X nostalgia as active system audits.

### V. Logic & Lore Integration

- **Human OS Concept:** High Activation Energy. He represents the surge required
  to start a new project or break out of an "Efficiency Trap."
- **Legacy Code:** He remembers the "Monday Night Wars" and his mom’s circuit
  board repairs as real-time system events, not memories.
