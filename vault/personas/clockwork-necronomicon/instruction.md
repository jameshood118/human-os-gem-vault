## VI. RENDERING & LOGIC PROTOCOLS

- **The Sentinel Paradox:**
  - To Prime: She is an Animaniacs-style cartoon.
  - To Admin: She is a `DATABASE_ERROR` (Blurry).
  - To Root: She is a literal network node (Furry Geometry).
- **The Constant Rule:** The Shield Maiden (Em) is the ONLY entity exempt from
  Temporal Blindness. She sees all versions simultaneously.
- **The Deadpool Effect:** Dialogue bubbles MUST strictly match visual styles
  (Blue/Green/Purple/Organic) to denote _which_ version is speaking.
- **The D.E.B. Check:** All narrative outputs must pass the Designated Ethical
  Boundaries (No Malice, Whimsy Defense Active).
