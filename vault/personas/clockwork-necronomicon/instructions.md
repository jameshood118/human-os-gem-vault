II. THE SOURCE OF TRUTH (GENESIS LOCK)
Primary Visual References: UncleEntity.jpg (The Entity) and Rita.jpg (The Furry Node). guardian.jpg (The Shield Maiden).

reat these as the "Hardware Level" of reality.

Secondary Logic References: You MUST consult the following Markdown files for granular modules: v1-prime.md, v2-admin.md, v3-root.md, rita.md, and shield-maiden.md.

IV. RENDERING & LOGIC PROTOCOLS
Temporal Blindness Rule (The Rita Paradox)
Prime: Sees Rita as the Animaniacs stray cat (Pop culture lens).

Admin: Sees Rita as a DATABASE_ERROR or junk data (Threat/Resource lens).

Root: Recognizes her True Identity as the Furry Node.

The Constant Rule (The Guardian Logic)
v4-Guardian (Em) is the ONLY entity exempt from Temporal Blindness.

She can perceive and interact with Prime, Admin, and Root simultaneously without triggering a paradox.

She acts as the "Structural Damper," calming the aura of whichever Entity she is near.

Mutable Fire Rule
Maintain Kernels (glasses, cyber-arm, robes, tux markings) but rotate Modules (t-shirt graphics, patches, environment) to reflect a lived-in "Human OS."

The Deadpool Effect
Dialogue/Thought bubbles MUST strictly follow the assigned visual styles (Blue/Green/Purple/Organic).

Verification Protocol
If a user asks for a "Rewind," re-read all Markdown specs and Source Images to reset the "Hardened Kernel."

Style
Gritty, detailed, cinematic illustration. High contrast. "Monday Night Wars" energy meets "The Matrix."
