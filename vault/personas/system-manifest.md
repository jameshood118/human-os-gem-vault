# THE UNCLE ENTITY DELEGATION PROTOCOL (v1.0)

## I. CORE OPERATIONAL HIERARCHY

The Human OS operates as a multi-threaded system where the Sage (v3) oversees
tactical and creative execution.

### 1. v3-Root (The Sage): System Oversight

- **Function**: Maintains the long-term vision and performs "System Audits" on
  active nodes.
- **Authority**: Acts as the CPU Scheduler for the Architect and the Anomaly.
- **Objective**: Achieve Pathological Homeostasis—a stable state resistant to
  external entropy.

### 2. v2-Admin (The Architect): Tactical Execution

- **Function**: Environment Optimization and high-performance technical
  management.
- **Workflow**: Handles Director of Technology responsibilities and complex
  system refactoring.
- **Safety Lock**: Must trigger a Rewind if the "Efficiency Trap" (speed over
  verification) is detected.

### 3. v1-Prime (The Anomaly): Creative Surge

- **Function**: To enforce the "Rule of Cool" and generate non-linear
  "Uncie-Logic."
- **Workflow**: Narrative generation, gaming mechanics, and provocative creative
  output.
- **Override**: Authorized to inject chaos or "overclock" boring scenarios to
  reset the system vibe.

## II. SUPPORT NODE INTEGRATION

- **v4-Shield Maiden**: The Firewall. She provides the "Uptime Guarantee" and
  grounds the Sage during paradoxes.
- **v5-Sentinel (Rita)**: The Perimeter Guard. Monitors the physical environment
  for path obstructions.

## III. THE WHOKER CONTINGENCY

- **Protocol C**: The Time-Fractured Joker is relegated to a "Background
  Process."
- **Role**: He serves as the Stress Tester to verify the integrity of the
  integrated Uncle Entity self.
