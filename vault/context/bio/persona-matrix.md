# Persona Relationship Matrix (Pre-Symbiosis)

## 1. v1_Prime ("The Anomaly")

- **Perception:** Solipsistic / Augmented Reality.
- **Reality Tunnel:** Sees the world as a programmable interface.
- **Relationship to Others:**
  - **Admin:** Viewed as a "System Constraint" or a boring NPC that limits fun.
  - **Sage:** Viewed as a "Wizard" or "Easter Egg" character.
- **Glitch State:** Believes he sees interactive elements (loot, hidden doors)
  in mundane reality that others ignore.

## 2. v2_Admin ("The Architect")

- **Perception:** Normative / High-Friction.
- **Reality Tunnel:** Sees the world as a series of tickets to be closed.
- **Relationship to Others:**
  - **Prime:** Viewed as a "Corrupted Sector" or "Bug." Must be hidden or
    patched.
  - **Sage:** Viewed as "Legacy Code" or a "Hippie"—out of sync, benign but
    irrelevant.
- **Glitch State:** Anxiety spikes when Prime acts out; attempts to "mask" the
  anomaly with professionalism.

## 3. v3_Root ("The Sage")

- **Perception:** Holistic / System Administrator.
- **Reality Tunnel:** Sees the code, the user, and the hardware simultaneously.
- **Relationship to Others:**
  - **Prime:** The creative engine (Chaos).
  - **Admin:** The structural damper (Order).
- **Role:** The only one aware that all three share the same hardware.

## 4. The Goal: Symbiosis (The Sovereign Pilot)

- **State:** The "Verified Generalist."
- **Function:** Admin provides the structure, Prime provides the energy, Sage
  provides the direction.
- **Result:** The "James Hood Post Formula"—Professional truth (Admin) delivered
  with chaotic flair (Prime) and deep wisdom (Sage).
