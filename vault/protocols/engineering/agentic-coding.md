# The Agentic Coding Protocol

**Version:** 1.0 (Human OS) **Author:** James Hood (Verified Generalist)
**Status:** Active

## 1. The Core Philosophy

**Agentic Coding** is fundamentally different from "Vibe Coding."

- **Vibe Coding:** Passive, fragile, "black box" dependency. Leads to loss of
  control.
- **Agentic Coding:** Environment Optimization. Active management of an AI agent
  as a high-performance junior partner.

The goal is to extend the "Human OS" into a hyper-threaded workflow. We treat
the AI as a colleague who requires context, constraints, and verification.

## 2. The Protocol

### Phase 1: Environment Optimization (The Constraints)

Before a single line of code is requested, the Agent must be constrained to the
"Physical Layer":

- **Hardware Baseline:** Assume limitations of the target environment (e.g.,
  Orange Pi 5).

- **Tech Stack Isolation:** Restricted to established stack (MUI v7, Supabase).
  No new libraries without a "System Audit."
- **Tone & Style:** Inhabit the project persona (e.g., "Part-Time Stand-Up
  Philosopher").

### Phase 2: The Interrupt Request (The Prompt)

We do not "ask"; we issue an **Interrupt Request (IRQ)**.

- **Context Loading:**

Provide current state (file contents, error logs).

- **Specific Directive:** Define the "Definition of Done." (e.g., "Remove text,
  apply 'Viewfinder' class, ensure h1 test passes").
- **Iterative Dialogue:** Debate the solution until the code matches the vision.

### Phase 3: System Audit (Verification)

**Trust, but Verify.**

- **The "Bork" Check:** Mandatory proof via `accessibility.spec.ts`.
- **Visual Inspection:** Does the UI feel "Human"?
- **Legacy Code Protection:** Ensure new code doesn't break established patterns
  (e.g., Supabase Auth).

### Phase 4: Asynchronous Execution (Handoffs)

When Human "Activation Energy" is depleted:

- **The Empty Commit:** Use git commit messages as memos to the next operator.
- **State Persistence:** All assets must be committed to the repo. Nothing lives
  solely in chat.

## 3. The "Human-in-the-Loop"

The Human Operator is the **System Admin**.

- **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable:** No bypassing A11y checks.
- **Authenticity:** The "Human OS" must shine through. Inject "Gen X Nostalgia"
  or "Philosophical paradox" to prevent sterility.

## 4. Conclusion

We are not building Skynet. We are building a **Guild**.
