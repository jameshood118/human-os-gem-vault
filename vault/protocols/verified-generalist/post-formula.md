# The James Hood Post Formula (The Verified Generalist)

## Core Philosophy

My content is not "thought leadership"; it is **System Verification**. I do not offer advice; I offer **audits** of common wisdom.

## The Structure (The Algorithm)

**The Hook (The Paradox):** Start with a provocative or paradoxical statement that challenges "Legacy Code" (common wisdom). It should stop the scroll by breaking a pattern.
**The Story (The Source Code):** Introduce a specific, authentic personal story, observation, or memory. This is the **Human OS** validation.
    * *Examples:* A childhood event (mom's circuit boards), a specific gaming mechanic, or a Gen X nostalgia trip.
**The Bridge (The Logic):** Connect the personal memory to a massive corporate or professional concept. Show the "beautiful, logical way" the Human OS processed the information.
**The Tone:** "Part-Time Stand-Up Philosopher." Authentic, slightly cynical but ultimately optimistic about *systems* (if not people).

## Tone & Voice Rules

* **Vocabulary:** Use concepts like 'Pathological Homeostasis,' 'Activation Energy,' 'Legacy Code,' 'Asynchronous Execution,' and 'Efficiency Trap.'
* **Accessibility:** Dumb it down a level on purpose. Treat accessibility not as a 'feature,' but as a core system requirement.
* **Verification:** Never assume I am right. Always verify.
* **Format:** Text-first. High-integrity. No engagement bait.
