# 📜 CHANGELOG: The Clockwork Necronomicon

========================================

All notable changes to the **Uncle Entity** life-cycle engine will be documented
in this file. This project adheres to **Human OS Semantic Versioning**.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### "The Structural Damper & Sanctuary Update"

## **Added**

- **Asset:** `v4-guardian.md` (v4-Guardian).
- **Lore:** The Green Dragon Sanctuary Node (Safe Mode Zone).
- **Concept:** "The Constant" – defined the logic for cross-era interaction
  without temporal paradoxes.

## **Changed**

- **LORE.md:** Refactored "The Assets" to include the Shield Maiden.
- **LORE.md:** Updated the Archetype Hierarchy table to include v4-Guardian.
- **Formatting:** Converted all Setext headers to ATX to satisfy `markdownlint`.

## \[2.1.0\] - 2026-02-09

## "The Stealth Tux & Temporal Blindness Update"

### **Added**

- **Asset: Rita (The Furry Node):** Integrated full visual specs for the
  "Tactical Stealth Tux." Locked in the "high-gloss black" coat and
  "white-tipped back toes" marking schema.
- **Logic: Temporal Blindness Rule:** Hardened the narrative barrier between
  entities.
  - v1-prime now interprets future data through 90s pop-culture filters.
  - v2-admin now filters unknown assets as DATABASE_ERROR to prevent resource
    waste.
- **Knowledge File:** rita.md and Rita.png (Genesis Lock).

### **Changed**

- **The Animaniacs Patch:** Refined the "Rita" interpretation logic. Patched the
  bug where Prime was assuming a cartoon stray cat; this is now a "System
  Feature" of his era-specific firmware.

## \[2.0.0\] - 2026-02-08

### "The Genesis Lock & Modular Hardening"

### **Added**

- **Genesis Lock Protocol:** Established UncleEntity.png as the absolute
  Hardware-Level visual anchor.

- **Modular Architecture:** Introduced the **Kernel/Module** system to separate
  immutable character traits from "Mutable Fire" (apparel and environmental
  variations).

- **Spec Sheets:** Launched v1-prime.md, v2-admin.md, and v3-root.md.

### **Changed**

- **Visual Continuity:** Migrated character descriptions from generic text to
  hardened Markdown specifications to prevent AI visual drift (no more
  "weird-looking" glasses or generic wizard robes).

### \[1.0.0\] - 2026-01-26

### "The Linguistic Glitch (Initial Release)"

# **Added**

- **Core Archetypes:** Defined the three stages of Uncle Entity (Young, Middle,
  Old).

- **The Logic & Lore Machine:** Initial implementation of TTRPG-style generation
  within the Gem.

- **Identity realization:** The "Auntie/Uncie" realization—initial "System
  Audit" of the childhood linguistic glitch.

## \[0.5.0\] - 2025-12-15

### "The James Hood Post Formula"

### **Added**

- **Persona Definition:** Established the "Part-Time Stand-Up Philosopher" tone.

- **Monday Night Wars Integration:** Linked childhood circuit board repairs and
  90s wrestling to professional "System Audits."

> **System Note:** "The system doesn't just break; it evolves. Every changelog
> entry is a layer of legacy code that makes the current OS more stable." —
