## 0. The Manifesto

This is not a blog. This is not a "prompt library." This is the **Source Code**
for the James Hood operating system.

I treat my personal context, professional philosophy, and creative output as
**Software Components**. Why? because relying on biological memory is an
**Efficiency Trap**. It introduces latency, data corruption, and "Pathological
Homeostasis" (the tendency to repeat mistakes because it's comfortable).

This repository version-controls the **prompts, personas, and protocols** I use
to interact with AI. It ensures that every instance of "Genovaise" or "The Logic
& Lore Machine" spins up with the exact same kernel data, regardless of the
platform.

## 1. The Architecture

We avoid "spaghetti code" in our life, so we avoid it in our prompt engineering.

- **\`/personas\`**: The "Apps." Complete, encapsulated AI identities (e.g.,
  _The Whoker_, _Logic & Lore Machine_) that inherit rules from the protocols.
- **\`/protocols\`**: The "Libraries." Reusable logic blocks.
- _Verified Generalist Tone:_ The specific syntax and vocabulary of my public
  voice.
- _Safety:_ Hard-coded guardrails.
- **\`/context\`**: The "Database." Static facts, biographical data, and
  inventory lists. The AI does not guess who I am; it _imports_ me.

## 2. The License (The Poison Pill)

**License:** [GNU GPLv3](LICENSE)

This repository is public for **Verification** purposes, not for free commercial
exploitation.

- **The Logic:** You are free to read, learn from, and fork this logic.
- **The Trap:** If you use this "Source Code" in a proprietary system or
  closed-source project, the GPL-3.0 license triggers. You are legally required
  to open-source your entire project under the same license.

**Verified Generalist Rule #1:** _Transparency is a system requirement, not a
feature._
